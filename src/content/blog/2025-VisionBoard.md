# El Dorado
## The City of Gold!
What do you want to accomplish this year?

What did you accomplish last year?

What areas do you want to focus on this year?

Are there any habits that you would like to have by the end of the year?

### Work
I am able to walk to work OR have a less then 20 min commute. I would be down to even do that on a bike!
I am working in AI. I also like the idea of working with wearables... 

### Family
- Kelly!!!
- Queen

#### Questions to solve
1. How do I display my stepcount on the lock screen of my AppleWatch?
    - I would love to work at Apple. It feels like a dream that couldnt ever come true. I'm not the correct pedigre I wont go to Stanford...
    - They use swift at Apple. So, it would be dope to see if I enjoyed their programming language.

### Photo Prompt
Create an ultra-realistic, cinematic scene inspired by the spirit of ‘The Road to El Dorado.’ Show two explorers, Kelly and me, on horseback trekking through a lush Mexican jungle, led by a small, sleek black dog with pointy ears. We are approaching a towering waterfall, behind which stands a gleaming golden obelisk. Emphasize photorealistic details, dramatic natural lighting, and a wide-angle composition that highlights the grandeur of the environment.
